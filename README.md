# Desk Height Logging Program

I just got this nice standup desk, and want to track how long I stand (vs sit). So I wrote this program to run in my system tray and connect to a sensor to determine if the desk is up or down, if my computer is unlocked, and tracks the data.

# Requirements

A windows 64 bit machine.  This was developed and tested on a Windows 7 x64 machine. I don't know (nor care yet) if Windows 10 will work.

An MCP2221 based sensor setup.  This will be documented later.
